## Features

- **Fully visualized artificial neural networks.** Watch neurons integrating input, firing, transmitting signals of varying strength and polarity.

- **Speed up or slow down time; step through individual simulation ticks.**

- **Evolution from scratch.** First-generation replicators have completely unconnected brains. Useful connections are found through trial and error.

- **No explicit fitness function.** Reproductive success is its own reward.
