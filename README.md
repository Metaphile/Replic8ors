# Replic8ors

Replic8ors is a behavioral evolution simulator that runs in your browser. It works best in desktop Chrome.

## Features

- **Fully visualized artificial neural networks.** Watch in real time as neurons integrate input, fire, transmit signals.

- **Make sense of busy networks with cool fisheye effect.** Mouse over neurons to highlight their active connections.

- **Speed up or slow down time; step through individual simulation ticks.**

- **Evolution from scratch.** First-generation replicators have completely unconnected brains. Useful connections are found through trial and error.

- **No explicit fitness function.** Reproductive success is its own reward.

## Todo

  * Single pain neuron. Hopefully network can correlate pain signals with specific smells.
